## Overview

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this Order-Summary-Component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
2. See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

initially i downloaded files essential for the development from Frontend Mentor
then i developed the webpage for mobile device and then for luptop owing to the fact that this is the recommended process of developing a website

## Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

i learned the techniques which is to select the right html element for the right content.
for example for annual price i used 

  <h2></h2>
  instead of 
    <p></p>
by this i am trying to learn a concept of accessibility


### Continued development

once i ended my css projects i would like to focus on react.
